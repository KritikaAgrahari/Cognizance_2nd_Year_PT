

### Ciphertext:

hoZyGgMHU4dM+8zgZAPXhA==


- The ciphertext contains the characters + and =. This indicates that it is likely encoded using *Base64*.
- Since it contains a secret key, it is probable that a *symmetric cipher algorithm* was used.

### Morse Code:

... ...-- -.-. .-. ...-- - -.- ...-- -.-- .--.-. .---- ..--- ...-- ....- ..... -....


- When this Morse code is translated using an online tool (such as [morsecode-translator.com](https://www.morsecode-translator.com/)), it decodes to the following secret key:
  
  *SecretKey: S3CR3TK3Y@123456*

### Secret Key:
- The secret key has 16 characters, which corresponds to *128 bits encryption* (AES-128) for the ciphertext.

### Decryption Process:
To decrypt the ciphertext, you can use the *AES Decryption Tool* available at this [link](https://www.devglan.com/online-tools/aes-encryption-decryption).

- Input the Base64 ciphertext and the secret key: S3CR3TK3Y@123456
- The decryption process will yield the password:

  *Password: algorithmissafe*

### Extracting the Secret Code:
By using the password algorithmissafe, you can extract the secret code from the PDF file.

### Secret Code:

CogML24@2024
